Module 4 Challenge

This challenge was significantly easier than the Module 3 Python challenge, particularly since Pandas already includes functions (such as .unique and .sum) that don't require defining a new function in order to complete. 

Most of the exercises in this challenge we learned in class, so I was able to reference class material for most of my needs. I did need to Google how to convert a series output into a DataFrame, so that I could easily merge all the school outputs into one DataFrame. There is likely an easier way to do this, but I found converting al outputs to a DataFrame to be easier for me to maintain and track, rather than series or lists.

I find StackOverflow one of the most helpful online forums, since most questions have multiple solutions provided, so that I'm able to test and use the one that works best for my goals.
